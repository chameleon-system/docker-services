# Chameleon system docker services

* This repository contains Dockerfiles for services needed to run Chameleon.
* All Dockerfiles should extend from official Docker images or other chameleon-system images only to retain a comprehensible chain of inheritance.
* The goal of this repository is to provide ready-to-run-images to be used in docker-compose application stack configurations that run the chameleon system
